## Translation Checklist

Please check all that apply:

### Files Modified/Added
- [ ] Created new translation file: `/src/lang/translations/[language-code].ts`
- [ ] Updated `/src/lang/translations/index.ts` to export new translation
- [ ] Updated `/src/lang/I18nManager.ts` to include new language in supported locales

### Translation Quality
- [ ] All translation keys from `en.ts` have been translated
- [ ] Translations are contextually appropriate (not just literal translations)
- [ ] UI-specific terms (buttons, menus, etc.) follow platform conventions for this language
- [ ] Nutritional/dietary terms are accurate and commonly used
- [ ] Numbers, dates, and measurements follow local formatting conventions
- [ ] Translations fit within typical UI space constraints

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] File follows the exact same structure as `en.ts`
- [ ] All interpolation variables (e.g., `{count}`, `{name}`) are preserved
- [ ] TypeScript syntax is correct
- [ ] File exports as `[languageCode]Translations`

### Testing
- [ ] I have tested the translations in the plugin (if possible)
- [ ] All strings display correctly without layout issues
- [ ] Pluralization works correctly for this language
- [ ] Special characters and diacritics display properly

## Translation Notes

### Context and Choices
Please explain any translation decisions that might not be obvious:

```
Example:
- "Macros" ‚Üí "Makros" (commonly used term in German fitness communities)
- "Daily targets" ‚Üí "Tagesziele" (more natural than literal translation)
```

### Pluralization Rules
If your language has complex pluralization rules, please document them:

```
Example for languages with dual forms:
- 1 item: "1 elemento"
- 2-4 items: "2 elementi" 
- 5+ items: "5 elementos"
```

### Cultural Considerations
Note any cultural adaptations made:

```
Example:
- Used metric measurements throughout (grams, kilojoules)
- Adapted meal names to local cuisine context
```

## Screenshots (Optional)

If you've tested the translation, screenshots showing the UI in your language would be helpful:

[Add screenshots here or links to them]
